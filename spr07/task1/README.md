The tasks of the topic "Babel"
There is a simple project.

Configure Babel for this project to compile files inside src, so that:

Files are in root of the folder src wonâ€™t be changed after compilation
All files that are in the folder src/lib will be compiled by Babel with the preset preset-env
If you use any extras dependencies describe them in the package.json, as appropriate.
