The tasks of the topic "TypeScript"
There is a simple project.

Configure this project, so that:

Install TypeScript and register it in the package.json

Write an configuration file to provide:

include to compilation files file1.ts and file2.ts from root of project
include all typescript files from any directory nested to any level of src, excluding files *.test.ts
concatenate and emit output to the file dist/main.js
all of the above configurations work by invoking tsc with no input files
