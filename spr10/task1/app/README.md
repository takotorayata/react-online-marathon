Sprint 16 - Lifecycle
Task1
Create component in ./app/Task1/index.js. It should send request to backend using Fetch API and then render "block#1" with result (Look at ./server/index.js! You can find some list to use in the task). Component should show "block#2" while waiting response.

Examples "block#1" and "block#2" at /screenshots

Install dependencies yarn install
